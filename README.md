Your phone and computer must be connected to the same internet

---------------------------------------

On your computer, download the files "Pc.py" and "IPv4.txt", and place them in the same directory 

IPv4.txt - This file must contain your IPv4 address, which you can get using the "ipconfig" command in cmd.

---------------------------------------

Download the files "Controller.py" and "kontsu.kv" on your phone. After that, you need the same "IPv4.txt" file as on your computer, with your IPv4 address in it. Make sure all the files are in the same directory 

Pydroid is recommended for running python applications.

---------------------------------------

First, launch "Pc.py" on the computer and then "Controller.py" on the phone.
